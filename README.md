# From mutualism to antagonism: coevolutionary dynamics of cheaters and context dependent interactions

My Master's dissertation that explore how the coevolution happens when cheaters shows up in mutualistic networks. Also, i wanna know how the fluctuations in
interactions signals between positive and negative influence the coevolutionary process of species. For that, i use a mathematical model that describes how
a certain average trait of species changes due to mutualism and antagonism. Latter i insert fluctuations in interaction signal's in time.

## Technical specifications

I run my simulations in two different computers:
- Desktop MacPro (Mid 2010) 2x2,4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon, 6GB DDR3, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6
- Notebook MacBook Pro 

The softwares used was:
- R 3.5.0
- Zotero 5.0.61
- TexMaker 5.0.2
- GitHub Desktop 1.6.5

### Repository organization

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
